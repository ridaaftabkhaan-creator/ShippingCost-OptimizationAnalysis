# ShippingCost OptimizationAnalysis: Baseline VS HypothesisModel Comparison
An analytical dashboard comparing shipping pricing strategies to optimize business profitability through tiered discount models and data-driven insights across 276 orders.

---

## 🔎 Project Summary

This dashboard analyzes **shipping costs for product orders** and compares two pricing models: a baseline linear discount approach versus a hypothesis tiered discount structure. The project highlights my ability to perform cost-benefit analysis, develop pricing strategies, and translate operational data into actionable business recommendations that drive profit improvement.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

### 1. Shipping Cost Efficiency by Order Quantity
- **276 orders analyzed** across quantity ranges (0-200+ units)
- Clear efficiency trend with volume
- **Key Insight**: Dense cluster at 0-50 units represents largest opportunity for tier migration
- Hypothesis model consistently outperforms baseline
- Outliers (150-200+ units) show best efficiency under hypothesis

### 2. Progressive Savings Structure
**Tier-Based Performance:**
- **Tier A (1-5 units)**: ~$0 savings
- **Tier B (6-15 units)**: ~$1 savings
- **Tier C (16+ units)**: **$24 savings** (51% reduction)

**Critical Finding**: Tier C shows dramatic savings  
- Baseline costs: $47
- Hypothesis costs: $23
- **Savings: $24 (51% reduction)**

### 3. Hypothesis Model Margin Improvement by Order Size
- Progressive benefit structure accelerates with volume
- **Tier A**: 50% value from hypothesis
- **Tier B**: 50% value from hypothesis
- **Tier C**: **67% value from hypothesis**

**Key Insight**: In Tier C, the orange (hypothesis) section is larger than blue (baseline)  
This creates exponential value, not linear—powerful psychological effect for customers.

### 4. Shipping Cost Savings by Region
**Geographic Distribution:**
- **East Region**: $3,000 (47%) - **Pilot target**
- **West Region**: $1,800 (28%)
- **Central Region**: $1,600 (25%)

**Phased Rollout Strategy**: East → West → Central  
Every region shows positive results—universal value creation.

### 5. Category Performance Analysis
**Priority Categories (73% of total opportunity):**
1. **Food**: $2,560 (40%) → Bulk-buy promotions
2. **Disposables**: $2,139 (33%) → Subscribe & save
3. **Cleaning Supplies**: $774 (12%) → Reorder reminders

**Strategic Quadrant Analysis**: Categories segmented by behavior patterns  
Food and Disposables require different tactics despite both being high-priority.

### 6. Strategic Implementation Priority
- **Star Performers**: Ready for immediate hypothesis pricing rollout
- Each quadrant requires different tactics (not one-size-fits-all)
- **Focus**: Upper-right and upper-left quadrants = 63% of total savings

## 🎛️ Pricing Model Comparison

### Baseline Model:
- Each additional unit costs **70%** of individual shipping cost
- Linear but discounted scaling
- Current standard approach

### Hypothesis Model:
**Tiered Discount Structure:**
| Units | Cost Percentage |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | 100% |
| 2 | 80% |
| 3-4 | 60% |
| 5-7 | 50% |
| 8-9 | 40% |
| 10+ | 30% |

**Advantages:**
- Aggressive volume incentives
- Rewards consolidation
- Doesn't penalize small buyers
- Creates progressive savings structure

## 💡 Key Insights & Learnings

### Why Hypothesis Model is Superior:

**Baseline Scenario:**
- Customer orders 5 items today
- Customer orders 5 items next week
- **Result**: 2 transactions, 2 shipments, 2× overhead

**Hypothesis Scenario:**
- Strong incentive: Customer orders 10 items at once
- **Result**: 1 transaction, 1 shipment, lower overhead
- **Savings**: Processing costs, packaging costs, handling costs

### Strategic Advantages:
1. **Operational Efficiency**: Consolidated shipments reduce labor and materials
2. **Progressive Incentives**: Creates natural customer behavior shift
3. **Universal Value**: Every region and tier shows positive results
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Hypothesis model profitable at ALL tiers
